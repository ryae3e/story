**Shared Dependencies:**

1. **Vue.js Components:** All Vue.js components share the Vue.js library as a dependency. They also share a common structure and style guide.

2. **API Service:** The `api.js` file is shared across all Vue.js components that need to interact with the backend. This includes `App.vue`, `Calendar.vue`, `EntryPage.vue`, `Dashboard.vue`, `Upload.vue`, `TranscribeButton.vue`, `TextEntry.vue`, and `Authentication.vue`.

3. **Flask App:** The `app.py` file is shared across all backend files. It initializes the Flask app and the database, and it is where the API routes are registered.

4. **API Routes:** The `routes.py` file is shared across all backend files that need to interact with the frontend. It defines the API endpoints that the frontend uses.

5. **Database Models:** The `models.py` file is shared across all backend files that interact with the database. It defines the database schema.

6. **Authentication:** The `auth.py` file is shared across all backend files that require authentication. It handles token generation and verification.

7. **Transcription:** The `transcription.py` and `meet.py` files are shared across all backend files that handle audio transcription. They define the transcription process.

8. **File Management:** The `file_management.py` file is shared across all backend files that handle file operations. It defines how files are stored, retrieved, and deleted.

9. **Celery Tasks:** The `celery_tasks.py` file is shared across all backend files that handle asynchronous tasks. It defines the tasks that are run asynchronously.

10. **Config:** The `config.py` file is shared across all backend files that need to access the app's configuration settings.

11. **Tests:** The `test_*.py` files are shared across all backend files that need to be tested. They define the tests for each part of the backend.

12. **DOM Elements:** The ID names of DOM elements that JavaScript functions will use are shared across all Vue.js components. These include IDs for elements like the calendar, entry page, dashboard, upload button, transcribe button, text entry field, and authentication form.

13. **Message Names:** Message names for communication between components and the backend are shared across all files. These include messages for uploading files, transcribing audio, interacting with text files, managing files, handling tasks, and authenticating users.

14. **Function Names:** Function names are shared across all files. These include functions for uploading files, transcribing audio, interacting with text files, managing files, handling tasks, and authenticating users.
